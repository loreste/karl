# Karl Media Server - Production Readiness

This document outlines the changes made to make Karl Media Server production-ready.

## Code Improvements

### Improved Error Handling

- Added explicit error types with proper wrapping using `fmt.Errorf` with `%w`
- Implemented metrics tracking for all error types
- Added validation for input parameters to prevent panics
- Enhanced buffer handling to prevent memory leaks

### Enhanced Metrics System

- Added comprehensive Prometheus metrics for all operations
- Implemented dedicated error metrics for monitoring and alerting
- Created metrics for success/failure rates
- Added performance tracking metrics

### Robust SIP Registration

- Implemented exponential backoff for registration retries
- Added circuit breaker pattern to prevent overloading SIP proxies
- Added connection timeout handling
- Implemented health check and status monitoring

### Improved Media Handling

- Fixed SRTP transcoding buffer allocation
- Added proper codec handling
- Improved error recovery during media processing
- Added extensive validation for RTP/SRTP packets

### Configuration System Enhancements

- Improved configuration validation
- Added runtime config update capability
- Enhanced security for sensitive configuration
- Added configuration defaults for robustness

## Operation and Monitoring

### Metrics

- Added comprehensive Prometheus metrics
- Created dashboards for tracking system performance
- Added alerting for critical errors
- Implemented SLA tracking metrics

### Logging

- Added structured logging with multiple log levels
- Implemented log rotation for production environments
- Enhanced error context in logs
- Added trace ID for request tracking

### Resilience

- Implemented graceful degradation during outages
- Enhanced reconnection logic
- Added circuit breaker patterns
- Implemented proper resource cleanup

## Production Deployment

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.23.2 or higher
- Prometheus for metrics collection
- MySQL database for session persistence
- Redis for caching (optional but recommended)

### Environment Variables

- `KARL_CONFIG_PATH`: Path to config file
- `KARL_LOG_LEVEL`: Log verbosity (1-5)
- `KARL_METRICS_PORT`: Port for Prometheus metrics (default: 9091)

### Deployment Commands

```bash
# Build for production
GO_ENV=production go build -o karl

# Run with custom config
./karl --config=/path/to/config.json

# Run with increased log level
KARL_LOG_LEVEL=4 ./karl
```

### Health Checks

The following endpoints are available for health monitoring:

- `/health`: Basic health check
- `/metrics`: Prometheus metrics
- `/status`: Detailed component status

## Testing

Unit tests have been added for all critical components:

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run tests with coverage report
go test -cover ./...

# Run specific component tests
go test ./internal/srtp_transcoding_test.go
```
