 Karl Media Server (Beta)
Karl Media Server is a high-performance, scalable media engine designed for handling WebRTC, SIP, RTP, and SRTP communications. It integrates with OpenSIPS, Kamailio, and RTPengine, supporting real-time media routing, transcoding, and security features like DTLS-SRTP. Karl is optimized for low-latency VoIP and video streaming, ensuring seamless connectivity across NATed and cloud-based environments.

‚ö†Ô∏è Beta Notice: Karl Media Server is currently in beta. While it's functional and optimized for WebRTC-to-SIP, SIP call routing, and media transcoding, further testing and optimizations are ongoing. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
