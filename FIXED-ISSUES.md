# Issues Fixed in Karl Media Server

## Core Functionality Issues

1. **Duplicate Service Initialization**
   - Fixed conflicting initialization in both `server.go` and `config.go`
   - Streamlined startup sequence in `main.go` to use a single initialization flow

2. **SRTP Transcoding Memory Issues**
   - Fixed buffer allocation in `TranscodeRTPToSRTP`
   - Added proper capacity allocation for the encrypted SRTP payload
   - Added bounds checking for buffer operations

3. **Codec Conversion**
   - Fixed `transcodeAudio` function implementation
   - Made codec conversion functions consistent and publicly available for testing
   - Improved input validation and error handling

4. **Missing Exported Functions**
   - Exported key functions for testing purposes while maintaining encapsulation
   - Renamed functions to follow Go's exported/unexported naming conventions

## Test Suite

Added comprehensive test suite with tests for core functionality:

1. **RTP Control Tests**
   - Testing destination management
   - RTP statistics

2. **SRTP Transcoding Tests**
   - SRTP context initialization
   - RTP to SRTP conversion

3. **Codec Conversion Tests**
   - PCMU to PCMA conversion
   - Voice activity detection
   - Audio normalization

## Recommendations for Future Development

1. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Consider using error wrapping for more context
   - Standardize error reporting formats

2. **Configuration Management**
   - Consider a more reactive configuration system
   - Add validation for critical security parameters

3. **Improved Testing**
   - Add integration tests with real media streams
   - Consider benchmarking tests for performance-critical paths
   - Expand test coverage to more edge cases

4. **Code Organization**
   - Consider further modularization of the codec handling
   - Better separation of concerns between WebRTC and RTP handling
